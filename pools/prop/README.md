# PPLNS Pools

## Explanation of Prop Pools
In the proportional method, a block's reward is distributed between miners in proportion to the number of shares each of them submitted since the previous block; the reward per share is the block reward divided by the number of shares in the round. Because of this, the reward of a share submitted at any given time is affected by the number of shares already submitted since the last block; a share submitted early in the round will have a higher reward on average than a share submitted later.

It is very favorable for switching between pools, but is prone to pool-hopping. However, most pool owners have taken action
to mitigate damage to profit caused from pool hopping.
