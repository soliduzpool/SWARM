Runtimes

SWARM has a script called runtimes.ps1

This script can be ran to create a daily start/stop time for SWARM.

Sample Usage:
.\runtimes.ps1 08:00 17:30

Allows SWARM to only run between those times. Will check every 5 minutes
It will stop SWARM, and start SWARM when required.

Linux requires install_linux (if not HiveOS) for commands to be installed.
Windows requires SWARM to have ran at least once for commands to be installed.

Keep file in main directory of SWARM. Should be ran while in main directory of SWARM
