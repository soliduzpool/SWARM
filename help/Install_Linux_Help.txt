install_linux is the installer for SWARM.

What does the installer do?

-Automatically adds commands to /usr/bin, so they can be ran from any console.
-Automatically adds all required libs to /usr/local/swarm.
-Installs Powershell (supported version).

It is recommended when you update SWARM, you run that version install_linux to update libs/commands/powershell
as neccessary.

Since it installs items in root, it requires root to run.
