Hive Windows Reset

HiveOS on the linux side is a complex program that is integrated directly into the runtime of the linux OS. SWARM in Windows does not
have the ability to do this. It is an application that runs on startup, and therefor issues like it accidentally being closed or
application/console issues can occasionally cause problems.

If you run into such problems- I have created a script that resets all HiveOS data (including parameters) to a near fresh-install status.
This means that you can run Hive_Windows_Reset.bat, and it will remove all historical data besides stat and configs (excluding parameters)

The instructions are simple:

1.) Run Hive_Windows_Reset.bat

2.) Start SWARM, and the help will start again.

3.) [OPTIONAL] Open SWARM.bat with a text editor, and add your -Hive_Hash parameter so you will autoconnect again.
    Instructions on how to add (and example) will be within SWARM.bat
