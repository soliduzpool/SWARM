# Miners folder

## What is the miners folder?

These are the scripts that SWARM pull to setup the miners.

## Why is there also a miners folder in config section?

Those are merely user configuration/settings. These are the actual scripts
that SWARM runs to do things such as:
* Divide miner by devices.
* Generate initial quote for hashrate/estimate.
* Gather environment settings.
* Pull user configuration settings, and add to miner startup.
