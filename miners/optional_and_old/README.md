# Optional and Old Miners

## Adding To SWARM
These miners are not be default in SWARM. They can be added by doing one or the other:
* Moving the file to the respective miners/gpu/[amd or nvidia] folder.
* Using ``-Optional`` argument.

## Why are they not in by default?
* They may not support the ability to specify individual devices.
* They may not support lower model cards/specific cards.
* They are no longer maintained/updated.
* They are of low quality/benchmark.
* They are difficult to use, non-traditional setup.

Any of the above reasons is why they are not in SWARM by default.
These miners are not officially supported by SWARM, so I cannot
gurantee they may or may not work. If you have issues, post
an issue in github repository, and I will look into it.
